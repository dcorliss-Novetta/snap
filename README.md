Snap: Thanos will delete your files for you
===========================================

An ASCII gif of Thanos's snap will display in the terminal when you type 'snap'. I create an alias so that this happens every time I do an 'rm' command.

Snap is built off of SL, originally created by Toyoda Masashi (see below).
